Z Endstop Location (V0)
##################################
The V0 uses the bed assembly to contact the Z endstop switch via an adjustable screw in the T8 nut block.
Ideally the activation of that switch will be at the exact bed height at which your nozzle also reaches the bed surface.
However there is a window of travel from the moment that switch is activated to the point at which that switch bottoms out,
this window is about 0.6mm. by using the adjustable screw in the T8 nut block and by being able to physically move the endstop
switch up or down along the extrusion you need to position these so that the point at which your nozzle touches the bed (your 
Z0 point) happens within that 0.6mm window of travel. You can then use the Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATEroutine to then tell your printer
where within that window you land, or in other words, what the offset between the z0 position and the endstop trigger point is.

Bed Screws (V0)
##################################
The V0 uses manual bed leveling. The bed is small enough and thick enough that a mesh or other types of per print
leveling should not be needed. There is a macro in Klipper to help with the manual bed leveling process: BED_SCREWS_ADJUST

This tool will move the printer’s nozzle to each screw XY location and then move the nozzle to a Z=0.3 height.
At this point one can use the “paper test” to adjust the bed screw directly under the nozzle.
See the information described in “the paper test”, but adjust the bed screw instead of commanding the nozzle to different heights.
Adjust the bed screw until there is a small amount of friction when pushing the paper back and forth.
This process will move all three mounting points of your bed closer to the nozzle so it is critical that you re-run the Z offset
adjust after completing this section.

Once the screw is adjusted so that a small amount of friction is felt, run either the ACCEPT or ADJUSTED command. 
Use the ADJUSTED command if the bed screw needed an adjustment (typically anything more than about 1/8th of a turn of the screw).
Use the ACCEPT command if no significant adjustment is necessary. Both commands will cause the tool to proceed to the next screw.
(When an ADJUSTED command is used, the tool will schedule an additional cycle of bed screw adjustments; the tool completes
successfully when all bed screws are verified to not require any significant adjustments.) One can use the ABORT command to exit
the tool early.

After the BED_SCREWS_ADJUST command has been completed rerun the Z_ENDSTOP_CALIBRATE command to to bring your nozzle to the correct
Z=0 position.
